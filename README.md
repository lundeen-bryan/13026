# Bookmarklets to User Scripts (Everywhere)

Transform bookmarklets from any website into UserScripts. If you see the monkey icon, you're a click away from creating a UserScript!

## Description

Originally developed by [Jesse Ruderman](mailto:jruderman@gmail.com), the initial script aimed to create UserScripts from his personal collection at [Jesse's Bookmarklets Site](https://www.squarefree.com/bookmarklets/). However, over time, the original functionality seemed to wane.

This iteration revitalizes the core idea, enhancing its utility by allowing the conversion of bookmarklets from any website. Spot the monkey icon? Click on it, and you'll have a UserScript pop up in a new window, ready for you to copy and paste into Tampermonkey or your preferred UserScript manager.

Though the core concept hails from Jesse, the script's revamp and the current code base have been significantly modified for broader utility.

## Features

- Detect bookmarklets from any website.
- One-click UserScript generation.
- Convenient monkey icon indicator for available conversions.
- Seamless integration into popular UserScript managers like Tampermonkey.

## Preconditions

1. You must have a UserScript manager extension, like Tampermonkey, installed in your browser.
2. Bookmarklets must be properly formatted as per common standards for them to be correctly transformed into UserScripts.

## Usage

1. Install the UserScript.
2. Navigate to any webpage containing bookmarklets.
3. Spot the monkey icon next to a bookmarklet? Click it.
4. A new window will open, revealing the UserScript version of the bookmarklet.
5. Copy the contents and paste them into a new UserScript in your preferred UserScript manager.
